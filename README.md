# Quiz-Guru
A Java project for voice dictating Quiz Bowl questions

I started this project in order to allow for everyone to get an opportunity to play during those road trips to tournaments and during practices.

This project uses MaryTTS (http://mary.dfki.de/) and the Quinterest question database (http://quinterest.org/).

This project was made on behalf of the University of South Carolina academic team, and as such the questions in the database are pooled from college packets or the college section of quinterestdb.

This project is FREE and OPEN SOURCE. Feel free to use it as you please, but make sure you give credit to Julian Rachele if you happen to do so.
