# ![Quiz Guru](src/res/quizguru.png)
A Java project for voice dictating Quiz Bowl questions

I started this project in order to allow for everyone to get an opportunity to play during those road trips to tournaments and during practices.

This project uses MaryTTS (http://mary.dfki.de/) and the Quinterest question database (http://quinterest.org/).

This project was made on behalf of the University of South Carolina academic team, but questions can be retrieved from any section of the quinterest database, including all difficulties, most tournaments (excluding proprietary tournaments like NAQT), and custom searching is supported.

This project is FREE and OPEN SOURCE. Feel free to use it as you please, but make sure you give credit to Julian Rachele if you happen to do so.

Have fun with it! Any suggestions or comments can either be issued through Github or sent here: jrachele@email.sc.edu
